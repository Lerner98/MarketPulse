## 7. Data Limitations & Caveats

This analysis is based on CBS household expenditure survey data with the following limitations:

1. **Sample Size:** 10,000 transactions provide directional insights but may not capture all micro-segments
2. **Time Period:** 2024 data only - no longitudinal trend analysis
3. **Geographic Granularity:** City-level only - no neighborhood-level insights for targeted marketing
4. **Category Definitions:** CBS categories may not align perfectly with commercial product lines
5. **External Factors:** Economic conditions, policy changes, geopolitical events not reflected in historical data

**Recommendation:** Use this analysis as directional guidance. Validate findings with primary market research before major strategic decisions.

## 9. Portfolio Talking Points

**For Technical Interviews:**
> "I built a complete data engineering pipeline using official Israeli government data. The project demonstrates ETL skills, data quality management, and EDA. I extracted actionable business insights, including identifying that the top 33% of products generate 80% of revenue, and that high-income households spend 1.72x more per transaction."

**For Business Interviews:**
> "I analyzed CBS household expenditure data to understand Israeli consumer behavior. I discovered clear market segmentation by income quintile, geographic concentration in major cities (Tel Aviv 32%, Jerusalem 15%), and seasonal patterns tied to Jewish holidays. These insights could help businesses optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies for the Israeli market."

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Used **REAL government data**, not synthetic datasets
- ✅ Demonstrates **business acumen**, not just technical skills
- ✅ Generated **actionable recommendations**, not just charts
- ✅ Shows understanding of **Israeli market dynamics**
